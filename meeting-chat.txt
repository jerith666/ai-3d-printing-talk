00:08:45.063,00:08:48.063
Lauren Dunne: it's a blocker!

00:09:09.861,00:09:12.861
James Benson: "It's a feature"

00:09:13.619,00:09:16.619
Kajal Miyan: Shower stopper

00:09:14.769,00:09:17.769
John Reeves: It used to work

00:09:20.968,00:09:23.968
James Benson: "Worked in my shower."

00:09:29.300,00:09:32.300
Lauren Dunne: worked in QA just fine

00:09:30.491,00:09:33.491
Lyle Seaman: I expect more dad jokes

00:09:48.798,00:09:51.798
Michael Mann: @kajal lol üëè

00:09:48.925,00:09:51.925
Goureesh Lanka: showstopper

00:09:52.930,00:09:55.930
Lyle Seaman: Shower stopper is a good start

00:10:01.090,00:10:04.090
Josh Tippett: kids ... any excuse not to shower

00:10:09.387,00:10:12.387
John Ackley: tsafeature

00:10:09.432,00:10:12.432
James Benson: It's a great stop too LYle.

00:11:46.841,00:11:49.841
Martina Pavelko: OMG so much worse is a distinct possibility with water.

00:12:06.520,00:12:09.520
Lyle Seaman: at least it's not toilets

00:12:20.718,00:12:23.718
John Ackley: every time I try to fix plumbing turns into a home owners claim ;}

00:12:37.301,00:12:40.301
John Reeves: There's a workaround, aren't there like 5 other places they can get water?

00:13:02.469,00:13:05.469
Lyle Seaman: I have redundant bathrooms

00:13:06.462,00:13:09.462
Josh Tippett: they're fault!

00:13:21.274,00:13:24.274
Josh Tippett: ... *their

00:13:29.966,00:13:32.966
James Benson: Hopefully step 1: "Turn water off" :)

00:13:48.010,00:13:51.010
Josh Tippett: get out the 3D printer!

00:13:51.038,00:13:54.038
Mike ‚ÄúPez‚Äù Hasko: I do like Matt's mental state of "I need to fix this shower AND document each step of it for a talk I can give"

00:13:53.767,00:13:56.767
Lyle Seaman: duct tape

00:13:57.478,00:14:00.478
Rich Abbott: super glue

00:14:13.757,00:14:16.757
Lyle Seaman: hose clamp

00:14:23.344,00:14:26.344
Josh Tippett: should have a 3D model for you in ~2 sprints

00:15:06.158,00:15:09.158
Martina Pavelko: Note to self: send Matt all the broken little plastic bits in all my small Chinese-made appliances that weren't designed to be repaired. &lt;rant&gt;Because they don't make things like they used to anymore!&lt;/rant&gt;

00:15:20.907,00:15:23.907
Lyle Seaman: super glue was not actually a good idea matt

00:15:22.676,00:15:25.676
John Reeves: Just expose the inner implementation details. Give the kids channel lock pliers and have them turn the thing directly

00:15:30.966,00:15:33.966
Lyle Seaman: boom!

00:15:48.948,00:15:51.948
Michael Mann: shower CLI

00:15:51.673,00:15:54.673
Martina Pavelko: Such a syncophantic AI

00:16:13.657,00:16:16.657
James Benson: Should have given it a Lidar map and see what it did.

00:16:51.307,00:16:54.307
Lyle Seaman: close

00:16:56.022,00:16:59.022
Josh Tippett: does the model have the cracks?

00:17:05.829,00:17:08.829
Martina Pavelko: lol

00:17:06.898,00:17:09.898
John Reeves: We're going for MVP

00:17:20.498,00:17:23.498
Michael Mann: pre-relic-ed with authentic cracking

00:17:26.970,00:17:29.970
Rich Abbott: lol

00:17:28.833,00:17:31.833
John Ackley: had a very similar experience trying to get 3d building models from chatgpt5

00:17:49.544,00:17:52.544
Josh Tippett: back to the channel locks!

00:18:44.470,00:18:47.470
Josh Tippett: have you considered a full bathroom demo?

00:19:15.373,00:19:18.373
Lyle Seaman: hire a boutique shower-dev firm, they'll build you a new one for only $50k

00:19:21.735,00:19:24.735
Josh Tippett: ... here is a video on how to use a sledge hammer

00:20:09.966,00:20:12.966
Martina Pavelko: can we recommend that Matt's in-person talk include the ability for people to add running commentary? Because this chat is priceless.

00:20:15.640,00:20:18.640
Lyle Seaman: google "kolher replacement shower parts"

00:20:56.423,00:20:59.423
Michael Mann: The Statler and Waldorf experience? Yes, please, Martina.

00:22:06.202,00:22:09.202
Martina Pavelko: Heckling -&gt; on

00:22:18.235,00:22:21.235
John Reeves: This to me is useful because I've been wanting to 3d print some gears for a specific use case, and I want to do the modeling myself.

00:22:44.074,00:22:47.074
John Reeves: Now that's a sphere Claude would tell you to print

00:24:54.564,00:24:57.564
Lauren Dunne: sorry have to drop Matt.

00:25:03.585,00:25:06.585
John Reeves: Claude, give me instructions to print a Penrose triangle

00:25:18.622,00:25:21.622
Lyle Seaman: https://www.amazon.com/GGTE-1070733-Faucet-Handle-Driver/dp/B0FDKSKG9W/ref=pd_lpo_d_sccl_3/138-9573410-1978657?pd_rd_w=uo5a7&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&amp;pf_rd_p=4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&amp;pf_rd_r=E6KM992T5KQ5Y9RAHHCA&amp;pd_rd_wg=WTiPq&amp;pd_rd_r=004db615-9720-494f-9d52-a790f43e1b8c&amp;pd_rd_i=B0FDKSKG9W&amp;th=1

00:25:26.530,00:25:29.530
Lyle Seaman: $5 and they'll deliver it tomorrow

00:25:54.411,00:25:57.411
Martina Pavelko: Or speaking of Playdoh -- maybe that would have been the way.

00:26:31.378,00:26:34.378
Michael Mann: "Can AI Help Me Shop at Amazon?" would be a far less interesting tech talk.

00:26:37.194,00:26:40.194
Josh Tippett: at least the kids will have plenty of 3D toys for the bathtub

00:28:59.499,00:29:02.499
John Reeves: "OpenSCAD The Programmers Solid 3D CAD Modeller"
Thanks Matt, this is speaking my language!

00:31:28.371,00:31:31.371
Derric Denniston: Claude, is my shower handle part topologically equivalent to a Doughnut? Write a formal proof please.

00:32:05.690,00:32:08.690
Ryan Ostrager: Mine isn't but my coffee mug definitely is

00:34:01.474,00:34:04.474
Michael Mann: physical integration test

00:35:08.746,00:35:11.746
Ryan Ostrager: physical stuff is always fun to debug because there's no log messages or debugger to fall back on.

00:38:03.381,00:38:06.381
John Reeves: I thought he was going to say "the part was too weak"

00:38:43.734,00:38:46.734
John Reeves: It's all one atom.

00:41:52.870,00:41:55.870
Martina Pavelko: this is like the instruction to carve the turkey against the grain

00:42:21.838,00:42:24.838
John Ackley: potentially more cleanup :-!

00:42:24.434,00:42:27.434
John Reeves: Hmm, I would have thought rotate 45 degrees, I wonder if the socket is a weak point now.

00:43:10.414,00:43:13.414
Ryan Ostrager: Fancier 3d printers can support multiple filament types so that you can make support material out of some other type of plastic and dissolve away the support material

00:43:24.242,00:43:27.242
Rodrigo Silva: great presentation

00:43:50.434,00:43:53.434
Martina Pavelko: Very engaging

00:44:18.695,00:44:21.695
John Reeves: So they DO get the channel locks!

00:44:25.623,00:44:28.623
Josh Tippett: great learning experience ... what do you think it cost you in lost opportunity cost?

00:44:54.746,00:44:57.746
Kajal Miyan: planned outage, counting against SLA or not?

00:45:38.886,00:45:41.886
Ryan Ostrager: I had to replace a similar part in my shower handle and I had to go to multiple stores before I could find someone who was able to order the part I needed from the manufacturer

00:45:40.228,00:45:43.228
John Ackley: planned obsolescence !

00:45:47.838,00:45:50.838
Ryan Ostrager: It was still an ordeal even without DIY

00:45:48.834,00:45:51.834
Valerie Beattie: I really like that the idea of collaboration/talking through things with others came in here to with your son's comment!

00:46:16.332,00:46:19.332
Martina Pavelko: it's not quite right, I think

00:46:43.683,00:46:46.683
Mike ‚ÄúPez‚Äù Hasko: #matt-mchenryfamily

00:46:56.817,00:46:59.817
Michael Mann: part Lyle found is the wrong color :D üé®

00:48:04.505,00:48:07.505
Mike ‚ÄúPez‚Äù Hasko: AI is the new StackOverflow, it will give you 10 answers, and 1 of them is correct.

00:48:11.616,00:48:14.616
Ryan Ostrager: If you tried googling with traditional search you'd probably have to spend quite a while to even figure out the right keywords to use

00:48:42.863,00:48:45.863
John Reeves: Thanks, I'm learning OpenSCAD now

00:48:56.065,00:48:59.065
Michael Mann: yeah, OpenSCAD looks fun
